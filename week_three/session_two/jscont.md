#### Objectives
-   Gain a further understanding of data types; Arrays and Objects
-   Scoping and Hoisting
-   Apply fundamentals to solve algorithm challenges
-   Using JS to manipulate the DOM

## Arrays and Objects
-   What are built-ins? How can we use them?
-   How do we loop through arrays? Access array values?
-   How does a JavaScript object store data? How does this differ from an array?

## Scoping and Hoisting
-   What is JS hoisting? What is 'hoisted'?
-   What is JS scope?

## Algo Challenges


-   Max/Min/Avg - Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns a new array that only contains the maximum, minimum, and average values of the original array. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will return [10,-2,3.5])

    -   Declare function, expect arr as paramater
    -   make a new array  
    -   look for max, min, avg values (for loop!)
        -   store max, min, avg
    -   push max, min, avg into new array
    -   return new array


-   Number to String - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and replaces any negative values within the array with the string 'Dojo'. For example if array = [-1,-3,2], your function will return ['Dojo','Dojo',2].
